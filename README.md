This was a request by FairyFlorra and I found the idea interesting, so here is the mod now for everyone.

This mod allows you to breed Ravagers with steak. Beware, they won't like you even if you feed them.

It is possible to lead baby ravagers as well as adult Ravagers

The offspring can be tamed by feeding it more steak, if you don't feed it steak it will grow up to an untamed Ravager.

Once a tamed ravager grow's up you can attach a saddle to it by right clicking it with a saddle.

You can also make Ravagers spawn in Savannah biomes through the config menu.


The Fabric version needs FabricAPI.

Forge does not need any extra dependencies.

For the config the midnight library is used, it is included as a jar in jar in this mod, for forge and fabric.
